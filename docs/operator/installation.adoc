This section covers the installation of the Enonic Kubernetes Operator.

== Prerequisites

Kubernetes:: A running Kubernetes cluster version `1.17` has been tested. Newer versions of Kubernetes might work.

Kubectl:: Is the Kubernetes command-line tool, kubectl, allows you to run commands against Kubernetes clusters. Download it https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/[here].

Helm:: Is a package manager for Kubernetes. Download it https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/[here].

== Storage classes

Before we deploy the operator, we need to talk about storage classes. That should be a familiar concept to people that have managed Kubernetes clusters before. If you do not know what they are, you can basically think of them as different aproaches to store your data (floppy, HDD, SSD, etc). Each storage class can create volumes that have one of these three access modes:

* `ReadWriteOnce`: Can be mounted as read-write by a single node
* `ReadOnlyMany`:  Can be mounted read-only by many nodes
* `ReadWriteMany`: Can be mounted as read-write by many nodes

The reason why we bring this up is because XP, when running in clustered mode, needs shared volumes for some data. If you do not plan on running any XP clusters in your Kubernetes cluster, you are fine and you do not need to worry about storage classes.

However, for XP clusters to work, you need to have a storage class in your cluster that supports creation of `ReadWriteMany` volumes. For example, the standard storage class in `minikube` supports all modes, but the standard storage class in `GKE` does not support `ReadWriteMany`. You can find a matrix https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#access-modes[here] that shows you different options.

You can create your own storage class with NFS that supports `ReadWriteMany` access mode. See our <<nfs#,NFS storage class>> guide for more information.

== Installation

=== Helm repository

Start by adding the Enonic repository to Helm and updating repositories:

[source,bash]
----
helm repo add enonic https://repo.enonic.com/helm
helm repo update
----

=== Create chart values file

NOTE: Here you might have to change the storage classes depending on your cluster.

Let create a Helm values file to configure the operator:

.values.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
# Set storage classes for deployments
config: |-
  operator.charts.values.storage.shared.storageClassName=standard
  operator.charts.values.storage.default.storageClassName=standard
----

=== Installing chart

[source,bash]
----
helm upgrade --install \
	--namespace kube-system \
	--version 0.7.1 \
	--values values.yaml \
	enonic-operator \
	enonic/operator
----

=== Verify installation

First find out the name of the operator pod:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl -n kube-system get pods
----

Then look at the operator logs to see if there are any errors:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl -n kube-system logs -f enonic-operator-<SOMETHING>
----
